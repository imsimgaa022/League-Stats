        share my progress with you. I'm aware there are a lot of bugs but I'm
        actively working on it and will be adding new features and content

        Quick tips:
        <ul>
          <li>
            App is made for searching League of Legends players and displaying
            their stats that are not avaiable in the game!
          </li>
          <li>
            Under search option there is list of my friends and my account
            (Jh√¨ntonic) so you don't have to search for players, just click on
            them :)
          </li>
          <li>
            Right now there is only option for searching players on Europe
            Nordic and East Server!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p className="text-center">
        App is currently optimized for desktop use only and will not function
        optimally on mobile devices. For the best experience, please use app on
        a desktop device.{" "}
